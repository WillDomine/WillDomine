## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Will Domine

- ðŸ”­ This year I am looking for an internship! I'm mainly focusing on school work this year, as I'm currently an 18-credit student.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang and deepening my understanding of the Flutter framework, while working with the Firebase backend.
  
- ðŸ“š I'm a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater where I'm earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a Minor in Cybersecurity with an expected graduation semester of Winter 2026.

- âš¡ Fun fact: The first language I learned was Python when I was 14 years old!

- ðŸ“« Ways to contact me!
